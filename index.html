                <h1>Evolution / Genetic Processes </h1>
                <p><mark>Not only is there the evolution of viruses to adapt and become more infectious, but hosts need
                        to evolve to combat the possibility of extinction.</mark> What this means is both parties are
                    evolving to become stronger. A recent study by researchers at the Department of Parasites and Insect
                    Vectors at the
                    Pasteur Institute in France and researchers at the Department of Plague and Immunology at the
                    Institut Pasteur de Madagascar
                    proved that lineage can affect the resistance of a rodent. <br><br>
                    The study's hypothesis was that <b>certain lineages of rats can gain resistance to plague, and that
                        previous exposure
                        to <i> Y. Pestis</i> can affect survival.</b> <br><br>
                    They wanted to observe this by having two groups of labratory-born rats, one who grew up in
                    plague-epidemic areas and the other
                    in plague-free areas. Both groups were infected with <i>Y. Pestis</i> and their immune responses and
                    survival rate were monitored.
                    There were many recognized factors that change how resistant they are. This includes but is not
                    limited to: species, genetic factors,
                    and prior immunity. The CCR5 gene and Class I Major Histocompatiblity Complex polymorphisms can
                    greatly alter resistance. CCR5 makes
                    immune cells susceptible to viral entry. Another example is Lipopolysaccharide, which can quickly
                    recognize the virus and
                    initiate an immune response. <br><br>
                    <b>Method:</b> They used the two previously mentioned groups, inoculating them with 15cfu
                    (Colony-Forming Units) of <i>Y. Pestis </i>
                    and 150cfu respectively. Finally they were all given a lethal dose of 15,000 cfu. <mark>Brain Heart
                        Infusion (BHI) was used as a catalyst for growth.</mark> <br><br>
                    <b>Results:</b> By giving one group 150cfu, they hypothesized the previous more substanial exposure
                    would make them more immune.
                    Morality wasn't noticeable, of the groups, 0 died in the 15cfu group, and only 2 died in the 150cfu
                    group. After the fatal dosage of 15,000cfu
                    the percentages proved the hypothesis correct. The mortality rate for the control group, 15cfu
                    group, and 150cfu group were 58.3%, 20%, and 15.4%
                    respectively. For those who did die, they lived longer for an extra 4.8, 7.3, and 15 more days
                    (given some margin of error). <br><br>
                    <b>Final conclusion:</b> the study suggests that any dose of <i>Y. Pestis</i> is beneficial (to a
                    non-fatal degree) to organisms. Exposure can help
                    increase chances of survival, the more exposure (again to an extent) will prepare immune responses.
                    Lineages of these endemic-area rats will also
                    be resistant to it. <br><br>
                    Therefore, resistance will be passed down through genetics, and will also be affected by natural
                    selection. Those with preferable genetics will live
                    to pass down their genetics and continue the lineage.

                <h1>Diversity of Living Things</h1>
                <p><mark>In terms of diversity, viruses can create and diminish it.</mark><br><br>Viruses themselves are
                    known to have negative physical effects on it's host. Direct and indirect cell damage can be caused
                    by (directly) diverting the cell's energy or shutting off molecular synthesis, or (indirectly)
                    integrating viral genomes, inducting mutations in the host genome, inflammation, and many others.
                    However these aren't the majority of viruses, there's a bit of selection bias in the news. Most
                    living and populated viruses, due to natural selection, are those which don't significantly harm
                    their host. This allows them to
                    multiply and spread others without causing their own death. So in that sense, the majority of
                    viruses won't significantly impact the diversity of its hosts. However, when it comes to the
                    impactful, globally spread viruses such as COVID-19, <i>Y. Pestis</i>, Rhotavirus, Monkeypox, and
                    many other deadly viruses, they can wipe out a large population.
                    Not only are they able to considerably reduce genetic and species diversity of their hosts, but they
                    themselves are able to evolve and create new strains, increasing the genetic diversity of viruses.
                    We've seen this with the different strains evolving from COVID-19.
                    <br><br>Because of the nature of viruses, certain genetics will let cells have specific receptors
                    that puts them more at risk of infection. Tropogen and viral proteins attach to each other allowing
                    for viral entry and infection to occur. Without the right receptors however, an individual's cells
                    cannot
                    be susceptible to infection. An example of this is the CCR5 gene, which if present will allow the
                    HIV virus
                    to infect immune cells. Because of this favourability from viruses or "viral affinity", individuals
                    without
                    the genes to protect them from these viruses will die. Reducing genetic diversity. Depending on how
                    widespread
                    and severe the virus is, the reduction will follow accordingly.

                <h1>Animals</h1>
                <p><mark>Tissue tropism is the viral affinity for certain tissues (or organs), viruses will often have a
                        specific "organ target" that they travel to, in order to infect them.</mark><br><br>There are
                    many factors
                    for tissues to be desired or ignored, some but not all include: cell receptors for the virus, cell
                    factors that recognize virus promoting and enhancing sequences, how well a cell can support viral
                    replication, physical barriers, temperature, pH, digestive enzymes and bile that are able to
                    inactivate viruses, and much more. These factors determine how long the virus will be able to
                    sustain itself and so it must pick carefully.<br><br>Because of natural selection, weaker less
                    dominant strains of viruses end up living (as they don't kill their host). The goal for a virus -
                    like any other living creature - is increasing lifespan and multiplying it's kind. This is why they
                    need target cells and specific sequences to complete pathogenesis as efficiently as possible.
                    Viruses, starting as virions, most often enter the body through the gastrointestinal or respiratory
                    system,
                    puncturing the skin, or through the gentials. These are all the greatest orifices of the body making
                    it easiest to enter for the virion. They also don't want to spend unnecessary energy transporting
                    themselves across the body. To counter this they enter the circulatory system, which will pump them
                    across the body. They do this by multiplying in the endothelial cells (walls between vessels and
                    tissues),
                    diffusing through the gaps, and then they're carried by moving leukocytes (a type of blood cell)
                    through the
                    vessels.<br><br>Once they've reached their destination, they begin to multiply and usually cause
                    indirect or direct cell damage. <br><br>In the final analysis, in order for certain animals to be
                    infected and not others, they need to have cell receptors that can attach and allow viral entry with
                    the virus. This goes for any virus and any organism not just rodents and plague.</p>

                <h1>Plants</h1>
                <p><mark>The issue with plant viruses is that they can’t get rid of the virus once it’s infected, so
                        prevention is often stressed.</mark> Animal-infecting viruses usually enter through the cell
                    membrane but
                    due to the hard walls of plant cells. They then overcome this by entering through wounds caused by
                    factors like branching roots, a damaged area by nematodes, insects, or pruning. They’re often spread
                    from one to another by vectors (organisms carrying diseases). Insects like leafhoppers,
                    planthoppers, aphids, and whiteflies transfer diseases by feeding on sap from many plants. This can
                    also occur if pruning or propagating is not done with sterilized tools in between cuts.
