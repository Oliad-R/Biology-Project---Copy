                <p><mark>In terms of diversity, viruses can create and diminish it.</mark><br><br>Viruses themselves are
                    known to have negative physical effects on it's host. Direct and indirect cell damage can be caused
                    by (directly) diverting the cell's energy or shutting off molecular synthesis, or (indirectly)
                    integrating viral genomes, inducting mutations in the host genome, inflammation, and many others. However these
                    aren't the majority of viruses, there's a bit of selection bias in the news. Most living and populated viruses,
                    due to natural selection, are those which don't significantly harm their host. This allows them to 
                    multiply and spread others without causing their own death. So in that sense, the majority of viruses
                    won't significantly impact the diversity of its hosts. However, when it comes to the impactful, globally spread viruses such as
                    COVID-19, <i>Y. Pestis</i>, Rhodavirus, Monkeypox, and many other deadly viruses, they can wipe out a large population.
                    Not only are they able to considerably reduce genetic and species diversity of their hosts, but they themselves are able to evolve and
                    create new strains, increasing the genetic diversity of viruses. We've seen this with the different strains evolving from COVID-19.

                <p><mark>Tissue tropism is the viral affinity for certain tissues (or organs), viruses will often have a
                        specific "organ target" that they travel to, in order to infect them.</mark><br><br>There are
                    many factors
                    for tissues to be desired or ignored, some but not all include: cell receptors for the virus, cell
                    factors that recognize virus promoting and enhancing sequences, how well a cell can support viral
                    replication, physical barriers, temperature, pH, digestive enzymes and bile that are able to
                    inactivate viruses, and much more. These factors determine how long the virus will be able to
                    sustain itself and so it must pick carefully.<br><br>Because of natural selection, weaker less
                    dominant strains of viruses end up living (as they don't kill their host). The goal for a virus -
                    like any other living creature - is increasing lifespan and multiplying it's kind. This is why they
                    need target cells and specific sequences to complete pathogenesis as efficiently as possible.
                    Viruses, starting as virions, most often enter the body through the gastrointestinal or respiratory
                    system,
                    puncturing the skin, or through the gentials. These are all the greatest orifices of the body making
                    it easiest to enter for the virion. They also don't want to spend unnecessary energy transporting
                    themselves across the body. To counter this they enter the circulatory system, which will pump them
                    across the body. They do this by multiplying in the endothelial cells (walls between vessels and
                    tissues),
                    diffusing through the gaps, and then they're carried by moving leukocytes (a type of blood cell)
                    through the
                    vessels.<br><br>Once they've reached their destination </p>
